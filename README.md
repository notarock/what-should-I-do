# what-should-I-do
A cure for boredom.

A small command-line utility to help you stay productive even if there's nothing
to. It's like rolling a nice, but with stuff you actually want to get done.

### Usage

Requires no dependencies, it's only 15 lines of python. Simply do:

    python3 what-should-I-do.py
    
and _Actualy do what the programs says._

Don't forget to define some tasks you want to get done. It can be
anything productive, educational or fun.
